//inefficient for sorted data
//applications-networking ,file system,databases,solving maths ,machine learning (decision trees),compression of files,it is directed acyclic graph
//node of bt has Node left ,Node right,int value
//height is the number of edges from a perticular node to the leaf node
//level is the subtraction of height of root and height of node ,so root level  =0
//leaf node are the bottom most nodes 

//types of binary tree-
//1-complete binart tree
